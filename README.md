It helps all students build a strong foundation for the professional career ahead. A good placements record gives a competitive edge to a college/university in education. Placements are one of the most important roles in a student's career. This study focuses on a system that predicts if a student would be placed or not based on the student's qualifications and experience. 

Have used basic statistical techniques like the Linear model and predict salaries of future references. Used the chi-square method of hypothesis testing to get the relation between the two coefficients. 

The data set contains: - Real-Time data and Kaggle website Data,17 columns,215 rows. Sl_no,Name,Gender,Age,SSC_CGPA,SSC_B,Inter_CGPA,Inter_Board,Inter_stream,Degree_CGPA,Degree_Stream,College_placements,Placed_company,Experience,Master'sDegree ,Specialization, Salary


# INTRODUCTION: 
Placements are very important for each college. The campus placement of the students measures the basic success of the college. Every student takes admission to the colleges by seeing the percentage of placements in the college. Hence, in this regard, the approach is about the prediction and analyses for the placement necessity in the colleges that helps to build the colleges as well as students to improve their placements. Campus placements provide the students with a wonderful opportunity to start their careers right after completing their graduation.

Moreover, they get to interact and engage with their company professionals during the placement drives, which further help lay a foundation for their prospective career in the future as they familiarise themselves with potential contacts from their chosen career field. Placements have gradually become an integral part of an instituteâ€™s offerings, which was not the scenario earlier. Nowadays, students pay special attention to placement records while selecting a college or university for admission.


# DESCRIPTION:
This data set consists of Placement data of students in our campus. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students.


# CONCLUSION:
Most of the people are from state background in the SSC. Most number of students have took commerce and management as the degree stream. We can also observe from the graph that very less population of the students have taken higher education. In the regression model we got an equation to predict the salary of the person based on the SSC marks, Inter marks, degree CGPA and work experience. We predicted the best fit model by taking new values of these attributes. From the chi-square testing of hypothesis, we got to know that there is no relation between degree stream chosen and college placement and also there is no relation between in which field one is working and salary they are getting.
