# Analysis-of-College-Placements
The following Project Aims to Provide an in-depth analysis of Placements. Placements hold great importance for students and educational institutions. It helps all students build a strong foundation for the professional career ahead. A good placements record gives a competitive edge to a college/university in education. Placements are one of the most important roles in a student's career. This study focuses on a system that predicts if a student would be placed or not based on the student's qualifications and experience. 

Have used basic statistical techniques like the Linear model and predict salaries of future references. Used the chi-square method of hypothesis testing to get the relation between the two coefficients. 

The data set contains: - Real-Time data and Kaggle website Data,17 columns,215 rows. Sl_no,Name,Gender,Age,SSC_CGPA,SSC_B,Inter_CGPA,Inter_Board,Inter_stream,Degree_CGPA,Degree_Stream,College_placements,Placed_company,Experience,Master'sDegree ,Specialization, Salary


























# CONCLUSION:
Most of the people are from state background in the SSC. Most number of students have took commerce and management as the degree stream. We can also observe from the graph that very less population of the students have taken higher education. In the regression model we got an equation to predict the salary of the person based on the SSC marks, Inter marks, degree CGPA and work experience. We predicted the best fit model by taking new values of these attributes. From the chi-square testing of hypothesis, we got to know that there is no relation between degree stream chosen and college placement and also there is no relation between in which field one is working and salary they are getting.
